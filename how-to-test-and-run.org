* Create a package
  - Write it
  - Put it into a guix checkout (not your running guix)
  - load the checkout environment with pre-inst-env. If you can't run
    guix in the host machine, run 'guix environment guix' before
  - ./bootstrap ; ./configure --localstatedir=/var --prefix=  && make
  - ./pre-inst-env guix lint my-package
  - on 'ERROR: missing interface for module (gnutls)'. guix package -i gnutls
